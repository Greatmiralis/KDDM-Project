# simple data loader that loads all the data into lists
# loads the data when starting the programm, returns list of superheroes, list of villains
# and an additional dataloader that only loads evaluation data
# the evaluation data must not be the same as the training data ie. 80% of rows is training, 20% is eval
# evaluation should be free from holes or blank spaces possibly
